# 🎬 Netflix Content Analysis – Tableau Dashboard

Hi there! 👋  
This project is a **Tableau dashboard** I created to analyze Netflix's global content library. It dives deep into patterns like content growth, genre trends, country contributions, and more — all based on a single dataset of Netflix titles.

## Snapshot of the dashboard:

## What’s Inside

An interactive and visually-rich dashboard built in **Tableau**, featuring:

-  Content trends by **year**
-  Distribution by **country**
-  Top **genres** and category combinations
-  Breakdown of **movies vs TV shows**
-  Ratings spread by maturity levels
-  Analysis of **duration** and **release years**
-  Trends in **date added** to Netflix
-  Text analysis of **descriptions**
-  Final dashboard bringing all views together

Each view was created as an individual sheet and compiled into a comprehensive dashboard to explore key dimensions of the Netflix catalog.

## 🤝 Why I Made This

I created this project to strengthen my Tableau skills and explore Netflix’s catalog from a data-driven perspective. The goal was to build a full-stack visual analytics solution — from cleaning and exploring the dataset to building a polished, shareable dashboard.
